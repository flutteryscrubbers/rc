## A collection of Configuration Files

### .vimrc

This vim configuration relies on Vim-Plug, which can be found here: [https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). After installing this, open vim and run: `:PlugInstall`.

The primary benefit of this is NERDTree. This .vimrc adds a hotkey to open it: `Ctrl-n`.

### .zshrc

This .zshrc relies on using a font for the terminal that is compatible with the agnoster theme. To use this, change the `DEFAULT_USER` at the end of the file to match your username. Also, don't forget to customize your plugins!

This config also works well with the custom theme Powerlevel9K. This can be found at: [https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k)

A good resource for fonts is: [https://github.com/powerline/fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)

### Fonts

I use FiraCode for my font.
